<div id="main">
<p>I see teaching as a way to encourage students to think differently
about something they thought they understood, while enriching that
understanding with new content. When I first approach a course, I
consider the learning objectives to ensure that they focus on two types
of skills – a substantive skill (mastery of content) and a technical
skill (mastery of a type of assessment, e.g. writing short papers). I
design learning objectives that are measureable and then I work
backwards to ensure that how I design my course supports these goals.
Over the quarter, students will have repeated opportunities to develop a
skill with low-stakes assessments while they get clear feedback on why
and how this skill matters for the learning objective and in a broader
scheme of their education or the discipline.</p>
<p>I work to maintain transparency in why we are doing what we are doing
– reading a chapter, practicing a method, writing a paper—by showing how
it builds to the whole and contributes to our learning objectives. I’ve
recently begun using a ‘course map’ as it can help formalize the
connection between the content and learning objectives to ensure that
the assignments build and support objectives. In this way, I have a
course with a clear and strong foundation to prepare and help students
reach defined goals.</p>
<p>In the classroom, I incorporate elements of fun and excitement about
the topic that can be contagious for the students. I also employ an
approach that is somewhat ‘flipped’ in the sense that we emphasize
important concepts through application and build on the readings. When
we talk about, for example, why institutions matter, we might consider
something like the recent tax bill and discuss the types of behaviors it
incentivizes or disincentives. Then, we explore this in the course
context – what are the ‘rules’ of the bill and how might people react? I
work to ensure that there are tangible connections between our course
content and reality. This resonates with students and it often helps
make what we’re doing ‘real’ in a sense they hadn’t considered
before.</p>
<p>I use the same approach in my ‘methods’ courses – although we are
learning more technical skills, we can still use and apply these skills
in a substantive context. The two aspects I work to highlight are that
there is often no ‘universal’ right choice—many students think of
statistics as having one set answer when in reality there are many
possible routes or applications one might select—and that there is a
broader real-world context for what we are learning and there are
implications to getting it ‘wrong.’</p>
<p>Finally, I see my role as one of a mentor: showing students why, how
and what concepts really matter. I do the same for my teaching
assistants as we work together to support the course goals, such as
holding joint sessions where we collectively discuss grading and
different assessments. I also allow them to be as active in the
mentoring process as they would like because an instructor, faculty or
graduate student, who is interested in and excited by the material is
typically going to be better able to reach students and deliver the
content than one who is passive or uninterested. In sum, I work hard and
demand a lot from my students and myself, endeavoring to ensure that I
balance the workload so that assignments make sense, support goals and
help students work toward mastery of the content and a particular
skill.</p>
